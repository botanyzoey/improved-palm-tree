The goal of this project is to run some spatial statistical tests on a dataset created using records from MyCoPortal digital herbarium. To create this data set I took the Lat and Long coordinates from fungarium records of the Pacific Golden Chanterelle (Cantharellus formosus). These points were then cleaned to get rid of any duplicates and null values and were then used to extract climate information from the worldclim bioclimatic variables set. These operations resulted in a dataset of 213 observations with 19 bioclimatic variables attached. Tests of autocorrelation, general linear regressions, and spatial error were then carried out on the data set.


The code provided is an RMarkdown document. The data is still being worked with for my thesis, if there is interest in it contact me at armstrk9@miamioh.edu
